            <p> Hello World! My name is Kimaris Rosby. Its an original name <em>as far as I know</em>. The story goes, my dads name is Mark and he found it too common and so he came up with Kimaris! It is pronounced (kuh-mar-is). I graduated from San Diego State University in 2019 and spent time as an <strong>Digital Content Specialist</strong> before the pandemic furloughed everyone. Im still in San Diego currently working at a tech startup. Working in digital spaces has always been something very interesting to me and the next logical step was to learn how to code! 
              
This is my first <strong>portfolio</strong> written in html/css I've ever done! please be relaxed by the 80's Miami pastelle colorscheme I tried to implement. The photo located to the left is a self illustration that I did as a phone case. I wanted to implement a similar color scheme so it wouldnt clash. So far the Thinkful coarse has taught me a lot about coding in a very short time. Its like rowing water out of a boat with a hole in it to but im up for the challenge!

            <p> Web development has been something that I've always had an interest in and it feels like I've done every aspect of web design but <strong>coding!</strong>. Ive learned how to do <em>3D modeling</em> on programs like Maya and Blender, <em>graphic design</em> using Adobe Suite, even made the logo the San Diego Automotive Musuem uses. I've also learned <em>videography</em>. But they all felt incomplete because you need code to make them work better. For example, while making a world in Unity for the Oculus, code was needed to activate and trigger scenes, which I unfortunately didnt know. I hope by the end of the course I will be a coding master <sub>or at least have a strong foundational understanding</sub>

Outside of coding my two passions are <strong>Chinese Food</strong> and <strong>fancy goldfish keeping</strong>. You can probably tell which resturant is my favorite by looking at the illustration I made to the left, but here are my top favortie fast, cheap, chinese food.
